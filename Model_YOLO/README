## Project Setup & Usage Guide

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies:

```bash
'python -m venv .venv'
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
'pip install -r requirements.txt'
```

---

### 2. Dataset Structure (Required)

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the dataset is **not included** in this repository. You must prepare your own dataset locally using the structure below.

Create a directory named `dataset` with the following layout:

```
dataset/
├── images/
│   ├── cat/
│   └── dog/
└── labels/
```

**Explanation:**

* `dataset/` → Main dataset directory
* `images/` → Contains one subfolder per object class (e.g., `cat`, `dog`)
* `labels/` → YOLO-format label files (automatically generated)

⚠️ **Important:**
Only raw images are required initially. The `labels/` folder will be generated automatically during the labeling step.

---

### 3. Auto-Labeling & Dataset Configuration

Run the following script to:

* Auto-generate YOLO label files
* Create the `dataset.yaml` configuration file


'python label_dataset.py'


After this step, your dataset will be fully prepared for training.

---

### 4. Model Training & Real-Time Tracking

Train the YOLOv8 model using the generated `dataset.yaml` file:


'python train_and_track.py'


**Notes:**

* Training time depends on dataset size and hardware performance.
* Once training completes:

  * A **live camera window** will open showing real-time object tracking.
  * Training metrics and graphs (loss, precision, recall, etc.) will be saved to:

    ```
    runs/detect/custom/
    ```

---

### 5. Re-Testing Without Retraining

If you want to test the trained model **without running training again**, use:


'python track_yolo.py'


This script loads the `best.pt` weights generated during training and performs real-time tracking directly.

---

### 6. GPU Verification

To verify whether training is using **GPU or CPU**, run:


'python test_gpu.py'


This script checks hardware availability and confirms if GPU acceleration is enabled.
