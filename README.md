# 3-in-1 AI Image Processing Model

This project was originally developed as an academic assignment for my AI course, but has since evolved into a streamlined, integrated application.

## System Overview
The application integrates three distinct computer vision models into a single, unified interface for convenience and efficiency:
- **YOLO** (Built by me)
- **CNN** (Built by me)
- **MobileNet** (Built by my teammate)

Rather than running three standalone models independently and dealing with the overhead, this project combines them into a seamless 3-in-1 experience. 

## Model Compression
A major focus of this project was optimization. Initially, the combined models and their environments required a massive **21 GB** of storage space.

Inspired by the compression techniques used by Arrowhead Game Studios for *Helldivers 2* (which reduced their game footprint from 80 GB to 20 GB), I applied similar optimization strategies to our models. 

We successfully compressed the total project size from **21 GB down to just 3 GB**. This significant reduction in size was achieved while maintaining the original performance and accuracy of all three models.

## Future Plans
While this began as a university assignment, my long-term goal is to continue scaling and improving the capabilities of this system. I aim to refine it into a robust, powerful tool that can provide practical value for real-world computer vision applications.
